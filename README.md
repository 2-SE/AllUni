## Presentation of the Situation and the Project:

### The Situation :
During our schooling in higher education (college), we noticed a few things that could be improved. 

  • We noticed that there are many means of communication on different networks. The messages are not very well structured either. On most of the networks, message senders can't really know who visualized the message.
  
  • There are a lot of website used. The goal/objective of that was originally to have a specific website for each type of content. It was made like this to have everything well-structured. This was done this way to be useful for the students. In reality, this does not serve its purpose, the information is scattered by all of the networks. Students are often lost when they try to find specific information.

  • Currently, to check the school time schedule on smartphones, students have to launch a web browser and go to a website, which is not optimized for phones. They also have to reconnect with username and password each time they close it. 
  
  • Overall, the communication between students, teachers and administration is not handled well. Each of the categories prefer one network over the others. (Messenger, Teams, Whatsapp, email etc.) 


### The Project :
To overcome these problems, we had the idea to develop a mobile application (IOS and ANDROID). To centralize every current applications of higher education (college).

AllUni has the objective to :
   - give Schools a better way to send a message to their students with a nice feed, 
   - see if the message is read (data-analysis), 
   - make a real calendar of all the events that have taken place and will take place in the establishment (meeting with professionals, open days of the establishment, conferences, etc), 
   - have our own calendar for all classes we have (as well for the calendar of others students/promotions of our school), 
   - have a schedule of free classrooms (with every specification of each classrooms like the number of places, if the classroom have a video projector, ect), 
   - and more...
